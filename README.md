# Transport mode detection

This project aims to analyze and study the application of some of thmachine learning techniques just to solve this detection problem.

In this particular case, the study relies on a very powerful data source, the smartphone sensors.

So, the goal is to detect the user transportation mode based on real-time data from the smartphone sensors.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the TMD Dataset, developed at the University of Bologna and
available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fschwartzer/tmd-dataset-5-seconds-sliding-window) (balanced version with 5 seconds time window).

# Try it!

Before executing the code from the command line, modify the dataset CSV file path in the cons
file.

Then, run this code

```powershell
python ./main.py
```
